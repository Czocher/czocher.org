Being a fan of the https://www.wired.com/story/the-decentralized-internet-is-here-with-some-glitches/[decentralized Internet
principle]
and taking into account the recent https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/microsoft-github-takeover-acquisition-software-development-code-latest-a8382456.html[takeover of GitHub by
Microsoft],
I decided I want to host my own version control software platform, independent
from any major provider (i.e. GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab) with all the
functionality of a modern software development environment which includes a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration[Continuous Integration]
pipeline. My choice came down to https://gitea.io/[Gitea] with
https://drone.io/[Drone] for the continuous integration purposes, installed on
my https://www.synology.com/en-global/products/DS216[Synology DS216+II].

The major reason for this choice was how small the footprint of both those
solutions is. Looking at resource consumption it constantly stays as low as 32
MB of RAM, which is the limiting factor on my equipment. A very big advantage of
Gitea is that it implements most of the features of Github, which includes a
wiki and issue management. Drone is a nice complement, adding the missing
capabilities while also not hogging resources as e.g.
https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins], another popular CI platform, would (also a good
choice for less limited environments).

The problem was how to install Gitea and Drone on my hardware. There are four
possible ways to install additional software on a Synology Disk Station:

1. From the official repositories by the Package Center - not feasible because
   the only two git servers available there are "Git Server", which is too
   simple, since it doesn't support pull requests nor any other advanced git
   workflow mechanisms, and GitLab, which is too resource-heavy for my needs,
   but may be a good alternative for any person with a more advanced Synology
   hardware (especially in the RAM department).
2. From the https://synocommunity.com/[SynoCommunity] community’s Synology
   package repository. Unfortunately as of now it does not contain any
   additional git-server software.
3. By building and installing by hand (or preferably creating a `spk` package) -
   it quickly comes down to a troublesome dependency management problem and is
   hard to deinstall completely.
4. By installing https://www.docker.com/what-docker[Docker] and using a
   container.

The last, fourth, point seemed the best fit for my needs, since both Gitea and
Drone are made to be run in a containerized environment.

## Gitea installation

Installing Gitea was pretty straightforward. Docker could be installed from the
official Synology repositories and has a simple, yet functional, interface.

Gitea’s https://hub.docker.com/r/gitea/gitea/[official Docker image] is
available on DockerHub, creating a container from it using the provided GUI is
very simple. There are a few things that have to be kept in mind though:

1. The ports have to be mapped correctly, i.e. TCP ports `22` and `3000` should
   be mapped on some host ports to be accessible. In my case it's a `10080` host
   port mapping for `3000` and `10022` host port mapping for `22`.
2. The volume for `/data` should be configured, so Gitea won't loose files on
   reboot.
3. The `app.ini` file has a few additional options: the `SSH_DOMAIN`,
   `SSH_PORT`, `SSH_LISTEN_PORT`, `HTTP_PORT`, `ROOT_URL`, should be configured
   according to needs, but _should contain the IP address of the host, not the
   hostname_.

My `server` configuration is as follows:
```toml
[server]
SSH_DOMAIN       = 10.0.0.3
HTTP_PORT        = 10080
ROOT_URL         = "http://10.0.0.3:10080/"
DISABLE_SSH      = false
SSH_PORT         = 10022
SSH_LISTEN_PORT  = 10022
DOMAIN           = 10.0.0.3
OFFLINE_MODE     = true
...
```

After setting those up and restarting the container, remember to verify if the
port mappings are still correct. In my case I had to switch those to `10080` ->
`10080` and leave `10022` still mapping to `22`, since the SSH server listening
on `10022` did not work and failed with a host verification exception for me.

All the other options should be done according to needs.

## Drone installation

Drone installation is a bit more troublesome than Gitea. The https://hub.docker.com/r/drone/drone/[main Drone image] can be installed easily with the
Synology GUI. I used the following configuration options:
1. Both TCP ports `8000` (HTTP) and `9000` (GRPC) should be mapped to some host
   ports. I chose `11080` and `11900` in my case.
2. The `/var/lib/drone` directory has to be mapped somewhere in the Synology
   filesystem.
3. There is a number of environment variables that have to be set: `DRONE_OPEN`,
   `DRONE_HOST`, `DRONE_GITEA`, `DRONE_GITEA_URL`, `DRONE_GITEA_PRIVATE_MODE`,
   `DRONE_GITEA_SKIP_VERIFY`, `DRONE_SECRET`. You can read what all of those
   mean http://docs.drone.io/installation/[in the Drone documentation] and
   http://docs.drone.io/install-for-gitea/[configuration for Gitea].

My config goes as follows:
```bash
# Manages if users can register to Drone by themselves
# I have a secure installation so it's 'true' in my case
# See more here: http://readme.drone.io/admin/user-registration/
DRONE_OPEN=true

# The address of the Drone instance, it didn't work for me with a hostname
DRONE_HOST=http://10.0.0.3:11080

# Use Gitea with Drone
DRONE_GITEA=true

# The address under which Gitea resides, worked for me only with the ip address
DRONE_GITEA_URL=http://10.0.0.3:10080

# Enable if you want to support private repositories or your Gitea has REQUIRE_SIGNIN_VIEW set to 'true'
DRONE_GITEA_PRIVATE_MODE=true

# Skip SSL verification of the address
DRONE_GITEA_SKIP_VERIFY=true

# Has to be a random secret string used for the Drone Agent as a login token for Drone communication:
DRONE_SECRET={your secret here}
```

The last, and hardest step is the https://hub.docker.com/r/drone/agent/[Drone Agent] installation. It requires access
to `/var/run/docker.sock` to spawn the continuous integration pipeline
containers. Unfortunately the Synology Docker GUI does not allow this to be
selected in the volume configuration, therefore it needs to be done manually
from a shell. Here is the correct `docker create` command to spawn the agent, it
should be run from a SSH/shell session on Synology:

```bash
sudo docker create -i --name drone-agent -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -e DRONE_SERVER=10.0.0.3:11900 -e DRONE_SECRET="{your secret goes here}" -p 11300:3000/tcp drone/agent:latest
```

It maps port `3000` of the container to port `11300` of the host.

After this procedure the new container should be visible in the Docker Synology
GUI, but _do not edit it there_ since it will lose the `docker.sock` mapping on
every save and will have to be recreated. It can be enabled/disabled in the GUI
without a problem though.

## Testing the environment

Testing if everything works is as simple as creating a new Gitea repository with
a simple `.drone.yml` file e.g.:
```yaml
pipeline:
  resolve:
    image: alpine
    commands:
      - echo "Hello world"
    when:
      status: [ success, failure ]
```

then logging into Drone and enabling the repository. Drone should begin the CI
pipeline for the project as soon as it notices a change. A change may be forced
by doing a `git commit -a --amend` followed by a force push: `git push origin
master -f`.
