Recently I've spent about 8-10 hours trying to install Fedora Linux 25 on a
Beagle Bone Black SD card. I had no serial cable, only a HDMI-mini HDMI adapter,
keyboard and screen. I'd like to share my experience so others may learn from
it.

The first step is to download a suitable Fedora spin. It has to be one of the
`armhf` ones available on the https://arm.fedoraproject.org/[official sites].
I've chosen the minimal distribution but any will do really. Remember to check
the checksum and the signature of the download:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Download the minimal image
wget -c https://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/fedora/linux/releases/25/Spins/armhfp/images/Fedora-Minimal-armhfp-25-1.3-sda.raw.xz

# Load the Fedora GPG keys
curl https://getfedora.org/static/fedora.gpg | gpg --import

# Load the checksum file
curl -O https://arm.fedoraproject.org/static/checksums/Fedora-Spins-25-1.3-armhfp-CHECKSUM

# Verify the checksum file
gpg --verify-files *-CHECKSUM

# Check the integrity
sha256sum -c *-CHECKSUM
```

After downloading the `raw.xz` file it has to be written to the SD card. There
is a number of ways to do that. The simplest one is to just `xzcat` it to the
`/dev/mmblk0` device, but it is not the best choice.

A far better one (if you're performing the operation on a Fedora desktop) is to
use the `fedora-arm-installer` package as follows:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

sudo fedora-arm-image-installer --target=am335x_boneblack --media=/dev/mmcblk0 --image=Fedora-Minimal-armhfp-25-1.3-sda.raw.xz --selinux=ON --resizefs --addconsole --norootpass
```

There are a number of benefits with this method. The `fedora-arm-installer`
script performs various additional actions on the written image eg. resizing the
SD card filesystem, enabling SELinux, disabling root password etc. The same
script can be used to write images for various other boards. For a list of
supported targets check the
`/usr/share/doc/fedora-arm-installer/SUPPORTED-BOARDS` file.

If you do not use Fedora but want to write a image to the SD card you can simply
view the https://github.com/sorki/fedora-arm-installer[source code] of the
`fedora-arm-installer` -- it is a normal shell script.

After the script finishes, the SD card should be bootable, but to successfully
boot it you should hold the "User Boot" button (small one next to the SD card
reader). Otherwise the LEDs will stay lit and the Beagle Bone Black will be
unresponsive, the connected screen shall remain black. Debugging this situation
usually requires a serial cable.

Pressing the "User Boot" button on every boot is of course unacceptable if you
wish to use this board as a server. There is a number of ways to boot the SD
card automatically but the easiest one, which worked for me, was to mount the
eMMC boot partition on the booted Fedora system and rename the MLO file.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Mount the eMMC boot partition
cd /media
mkdir boot
mount /dev/mmcblk1p1 ./boot

# Move the MLO file
mv ./boot/MLO ./boot/MLO_backup

# Unmount
umount ./boot
```

After this operation the Beagle Bone Black should boot the SD card
automatically.
